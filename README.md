# PySpreadsheet
A high-performance spreadsheet library for Node, powered by Python open source libraries. PySpreadsheet can be used
to read and write Excel files in both XLS and XLSX formats.

IMPORTANT: PySpreadsheet is a work in progress. This is not a stable release.

## Features

+ Faster and more memory efficient than most JS-only alternatives
+ Uses child processes for isolation and parallelization (will not leak the Node process)
+ Support for both XLS and XLSX formats
+ Can stream large files with a familiar API
+ Native integration with Javascript objects

## Limitations

+ Reading does not parse formats, only data
+ Cannot edit existing files
+ Basic XLS writing capabilities
+ Incomplete API

## Installation
```bash
npm install pyspreadsheet
```

Python dependencies are installed automatically by downloading the latest version from their repositories. These dependencies are:

+ [xlrd](http://github.com/python-excel/xlrd) and [xlwt](http://github.com/python-excel/xlwt), by Python Excel
+ [XlsxWriter](http://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter), by John McNamara

## Documentation

### Reading a file with the `SpreadsheetReader` class

Use the `SpreadsheetReader` class to read spreadsheet files. It can be used for reading an entire file into memory or as a stream-like object.

#### Reading a file into memory

Reading a file into memory will output the entire contents of the file in an easy-to-use structure.

```js
var SpreadsheetReader = require('pyspreadsheet').SpreadsheetReader;

SpreadsheetReader.read('input.xlsx', function (err, workbook) {
  // Iterate on sheets
  workbook.sheets.forEach(function (sheet) {
    console.log('sheet: %s', sheet.name);
    // Iterate on rows
    sheet.rows.forEach(function (row) {
      // Iterate on cells
      row.forEach(function (cell) {
        console.log('%s: %s', cell.address, cell.value);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

#### Streaming a large file

You can use `SpreadsheetReader` just like a Node readable stream. This is the preferred method for reading larger files.

```javascript
var SpreadsheetReader = require('pyspreadsheet').SpreadsheetReader;
var reader = new SpreadsheetReader('examples/sample.xlsx');

reader.on('open', function (workbook) {
  // file is open
  console.log('opened ' + workbook.file);
}).on('data', function (data) {
  // data is being received
  console.log('buffer contains %d rows from sheet "%s"', data.rows.length, data.sheet.name);
}).on('close', function () {
  // file is now closed
  console.log('file closed');
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // got an error
  throw err;
});
```

### Writing a file with the `SpreadsheetWriter` class

Use the `SpreadsheetWriter` class to write files. It can only write new files, it cannot edit existing files.

```js
var SpreadsheetWriter = require('pyspreadsheet').SpreadsheetWriter;
var writer = new SpreadsheetWriter('examples/output.xlsx');

// write a string at cell A1
writer.write(0, 0, 'hello world!');

writer.save(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('file saved!');
});
```

#### Adding sheets

Use the `addSheet` method to add a new sheet. If data is written without adding a sheet first, a default "Sheet1" is automatically added.

```js
var SpreadsheetWriter = require('pyspreadsheet').SpreadsheetWriter;
var writer = new SpreadsheetWriter('examples/output.xlsx');
writer.addSheet('my sheet').write(0, 0, 'hello');
```

#### Writing data

Use the `write` method to write data to the designated cell. All Javascript built-in types are supported.

```js
writer.write(0, 0, 'hello world!');
```

##### Formulas

Formulas are parsed from strings. To write formulas, just prepend your string value with "=".

```js
writer.write(2, 0, '=A1+A2');
```

Note that values calculated from formulas cannot be obtained until the file has been opened once with a spreadsheet client (like Microsoft Excel).

##### Writing multiple cells

Use arrays to write multiple cells at once horizontally.

```js
writer.write(0, 0, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']);
```

Use two-dimensional arrays to write multiple rows at once.

```js
writer.write(0, 0, [
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
  ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'],
]);
```

Cells can be merged by using the `merge_range` method.

```js
writer.merge_range('B2:E5', "merge_range Test");
```

### Formatting

Cells can be formatted by specifying format properties.

```js
writer.write(0, 0, 'hello', {
  font: {
    name: 'Calibri',
    size: 12
  }
});
```

Formats can also be reused by using the `addFormat` method.

```js
writer.addFormat('title', {
  font: { bold: true, color: '#ffffff' },
  fill: '#000000'
});

writer.write(0, 0, ['heading 1', 'heading 2', 'heading 3'], 'title');
```

Cell with rich content.

```js
writer.addFormat('redFormat', {
  font: { bold: true, color: '#ff0000' },
});
writer.addFormat('greenFormat', {
  font: { color: '#00ff00' },
});
writer.write_rich_string(0,0,'default ','redFormat',' red ','greenFormat','green');
```

Set a row height

```js
writer.set_row(0,{height:100});
```
